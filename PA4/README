Assignment Name: Programming Assignment 4 -- Graph ADT
Descriptions: 


File: Graph.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graph.c is the implementation file for the Graph ADT. It represents an 
implementation of a Graph object, which is a combinatorial structure that 
is represented by two sets, a set of vertices and edges.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: Graph.h
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graph.h is the header file for Graph.c, which describes all the functions
used in order to implement this instance of the Graph ADT.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: List.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
List.c is a part of the implementation of the List ADT, whose set of 
mathematical structures is any sequence of finite integers such that at most 
one element is "underscored", i.e. is pointed to by the cursor (iterator). 
This is the implementation file for List, defining all the functions for 
the List ADT. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: List.h
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
List.h is a part of implementation of the List ADT, whose set of mathematical 
structures is any sequence of finite integers such that at most one element 
is "underscored", i.e. is pointed to by the cursor (iterator). This is the 
specification file for the List ADT, describing the functions for it in C. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: FindPath.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FindPath.c is the top level client for this project. It takes an input file
of distinct pairs of vertices, and finds a shortest path between them, 
printing that path to an output file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: GraphClient.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A test client for the Graph ADT. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: Makefile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile for CMPS 101 Programming Assignment 4, taken from the CMPS 101 site
