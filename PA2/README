Assignment Name: Programming Assignment 2 -- List ADT
Descriptions: 


File: List.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
List.c is a part of the implementation of the List ADT, whose set of 
mathematical structures is any sequence of finite integers such that at most 
one element is "underscored", i.e. is pointed to by the cursor (iterator). Its 
purpose in this lab is to store the sorted indices of an array of strings that 
are extracted from an input file in the client Lex.c. Also, in C, this is the 
implementation file for List, defining all the functions for the List ADT. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: List.h
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
List.h is a part of implementation of the List ADT, whose set of mathematical 
structures is any sequence of finite integers such that at most one element 
is "underscored", i.e. is pointed to by the cursor (iterator). This is the 
specification file for the List ADT, describing the functions for it in C. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File: Lex.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lex.c is the client that implements the List ADT in order to sort the 
elements of an input array, read as strings from a file, indirectly. It uses
an algorithm similar to InsertionSort to store the indices of the string 
array in sorted order. In then writes the sorted string array to a file.

File: ListClient.c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A test client for the List ADT provided by the instructor.

File: Makefile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile for CMPS 101 Programming Assignment 2

      make                   makes Lex
      make ListClient        makes ListClient
